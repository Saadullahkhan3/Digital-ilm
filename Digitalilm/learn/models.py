It deletes related things, such as
When a User(Tutor) deletes its account then question sheets which are related to this Tutor will also be deleted and because question sheets are deleted then questions which are related to question sheet will also be deleted
BUT it not happened in reverse order, means if any question is deleted, it not auto delete related question sheet and also when any question sheet deleted, it not also delete Tutor account.
It works like a tree, where if root removed entire tree falldown but if any leaf dead, nothing happened to root.
